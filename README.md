The three core tenants of NetQ are that it is preventative, proactive and diagnostic.


NetQ is a telemetry-based fabric validation system, that ensures the network is behaving as intended.

NetQ helps you efficiently determine if the configurations accurately represent what you intend the network to do.

In the proactive workflow, NetQ algorithmically checks for faulty network behavior that results in packet loss or connectivity issues and sends real-time alerts to notify users that a network state deviation has occurred. When alerted, you’ll know precisely where the fault occurred so you can remediate quickly.

Proactive alerts for quick remediation. NetQ detects faulty network state and alerts you in real time with precise fault location.

At a certain point, the network that you and your IT workers love to tinker with and  manually troubleshoot will become a giant, time-consuming risk.

Fortunately, there is an easy fix for this problem: automate your network troubleshooting.

PathSolutions TotalView is a fully-automated network root-cause troubleshooting platform that will thoroughly scan all layers of your network, right down to the physical layer.

You’ll find that by using TotalView, you’ll actually gain a much deeper understanding of your network than you currently have. Plus, you’ll spend far less time searching for root cause issues when problems arise. You will therefore have more time to focus on business development.

## With troubleshooter, you can:


## Usecases
- Enable logging for DNS query debugging
- Saves time in troubleshooting, quickly identify the issue
- SCenario: With that said, I do suggest to please update the self-managed nodes to similar version of your cluster which is 1.14, this will then remove the incompatibilities between you worker node and kube-proxy. To update a worker node, you can deploy a new worker node group, using the procedure on link [3]. ....

Worker node and kube-proxy versions are different
